# Hyperspectral-Analysis

## What is it 
Hyperspectral-Analysis is a project that tackles the problem of Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification. The solution of said group of problems is important due to its real-life application like surface mapping using satellite images. Since hyperspectral imaging results in multiple bands of images, the analysis is significantly harder and less intuitive than that of 3D images and is characterized by a higher volume of images.
